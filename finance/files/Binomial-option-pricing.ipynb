    "# Binomial options pricing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a notebook about the Binomial Options Pricing model. Our main reference is \"Introduction to the Mathematics of Finance\" by Steven Roman (2nd Edition, Springer, 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $u$ is the up-tick factor\n",
    "* $d$ is the down-tick factor\n",
    "* $r$ is the (constant) risk-free interest rate\n",
    "* $S_0$ is the initial value of the stock\n",
    "* $K$ is the strike price of an option\n",
    "* $T$ is the number of time intervals\n",
    "* $\\Delta t$ is the size of a single time interval\n",
    "\n",
    "For a real number $x$, let $(x)^+ = \\mathrm{ReLU}(x) = \\mathrm{max}(0,x)$. The initial value of a call option (resp. put option) with strike price $K$ and expiry date after $T \\Delta t$ units of time is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{call}) = e^{-rT\\Delta t} \\sum_{k=0}^T { n \\choose k} \\left( S_0 u^k d^{T-k} - K\\right)^+ \\pi^k (1-\\pi)^{T-k},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{put}) = e^{-rT\\Delta t} \\sum_{k=0}^T { n \\choose k} \\left( K - S_0 u^k d^{T-k} \\right)^+ \\pi^k (1-\\pi)^{T-k},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\pi$ is the risk-free (or martingale) up-tick probability, and is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi = \\frac{e^{r\\Delta t} - d}{u-d}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is free of arbitrage if and only if $d < e^{r \\Delta t} < u$. We also have: $1-\\pi = \\frac{u - e^{r \\Delta t}}{u-d}$. Note that the actual, real-world probability of an up-tick or down-tick are not relevant for computing the initial value of a call option. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Special case: $T = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is only one time step, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{call}) = e^{-r\\Delta t} \\left(  \\left(u S_0  - K\\right)^+ \\pi +  \\left(d S_0 - K \\right)^+ (1-\\pi) \\right),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{put}) = e^{-r\\Delta t} \\left(  \\left(K - u S_0 \\right)^+ \\pi +  \\left(K - d S_0  \\right)^+ (1-\\pi) \\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single time step, it is generally the case that $dS_0 < K < u S_0$, so that the equations reduce to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{call}) = e^{-r\\Delta t}  \\left(u S_0  - K\\right) \\pi, \\qquad \\qquad \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{put}) = e^{-r\\Delta t}   \\left(K - d S_0  \\right) (1-\\pi).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special case: $ud = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "The martingale up-tick probability becomes: $\\pi = \\frac{u e^{r \\Delta t} - 1 }{u^2 - 1}$. Also $S_0 u^k d^{T-k} = S_0 u^{2k - T}$.  If, in addtion, the interest rate is zero, then $\\pi = \\frac{1}{u+1}$ and $1 - \\pi = \\frac{u}{u+1}$, so the formulas reduce to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{call}) = \\frac{1}{(u+1)^{T+1}} \\sum_{k=0}^T { n \\choose k} \\left( S_0 u^{2k-T} - K\\right)^+ u^{T-k},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal I_0(\\mathrm{put}) = \\frac{1}{(u+1)^{T+1}}  \\sum_{k=0}^T { n \\choose k} \\left( K - S_0 u^{2k-T} \\right)^+  u^{T-k},$$\n",
